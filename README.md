# Penicillin Production Modeling Project

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python, MATLAB, and Maple scripts designed to perform computational analysis and visualizations for the mathematical modeling of Penicillin G production using industrial-scale fermentation data. The scripts facilitate model development, parameter estimation, numerical simulations, and visual representation of results, enabling better understanding and optimization of the fermentation process.

## Project Introduction
Since Alexander Flemming’s discovery of Penicillin’s antibiotic properties in 1929, significant progress has been made in improving its yield and production methods. Over the past 70 years, Penicillium chrysogenum (P. chrysogenum) has been used extensively in large-scale production, with mathematical modeling playing a critical role in optimizing the process. Mathematical models describe relationships between key variables, such as biomass, substrate, and product, often through ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

This project aims to construct a mathematical model that captures the dynamics observed in industrial-scale fermentation processes of Penicillin G. By leveraging industrial-scale data and revisiting foundational models, this work highlights the relevance of simple, low-dimensional models in providing reliable predictions. These models are particularly useful during the initial stages of fermentation process development, reducing costs and enabling early-stage decision-making.

The research question guiding this project is:
> How is a low-dimensional, coarse-grain model able to reflect the dynamics of a real industrial-scale fermentation process of Penicillium chrysogenum?
